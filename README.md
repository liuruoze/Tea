# Tea

Tea is a simple, light-weight Deep Learning framework aims for reading, teaching and learning.

Tea is not aimed to be production use. It has no GPU support. So you could not train a large neural network through it. 
But good things are, you do not need to install CUDA, cuDNN, and even Linux. This is a qucik start for learning CNN.

So, there are no rules and no patterns. The only things are:

* Clear to read.
* Easy to understand.
* Simple to exnted.
